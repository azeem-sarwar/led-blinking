# Fixing PlatformIO Arduino Upload Error

If you encounter the error:

```
could not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```

This indicates insufficient permissions to access the USB port. Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

---

## 1. Verify the Device is Detected

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
```

- Ensure `/dev/ttyUSB0` (or another port) appears in the list.
- If not, check your Arduino connection or try a different USB cable/port.

---

## 2. Grant Access to the Port

Add your user to the `dialout` group, which controls access to serial ports:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

- Log out and log back in, or restart your system to apply the changes.

---

## 3. Check and Set Permissions

Set appropriate read/write permissions for the port:

```bash
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
```

---

## 4. Install PlatformIO Udev Rules

Install the PlatformIO udev rules to help manage USB devices correctly:
 
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core/develop/platformio/assets/system/99-platformio-udev.rules
sudo cp 99-platformio-udev.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

---

## 5. Ensure Proper Board Selection in PlatformIO

Open your `platformio.ini` file and verify the correct board and environment settings:

```ini
[env:uno]
platform = atmelavr
board = uno
framework = arduino
```

Save the file and rebuild the project.

---

## 6. Retry Upload

Run the following command to upload your code:

```bash
platformio run --target upload
```

---

## Additional Debugging

### Test with Arduino IDE
- If the issue persists, upload the code using the Arduino IDE to verify the hardware is functioning correctly.

### Check USB Drivers
- Install necessary drivers (e.g., CH340 or FTDI drivers for Arduino clones).

### Confirm the Correct Port
- Run the following command to verify the correct port:
  ```bash
  dmesg | grep tty
  ```

---

Following these steps should resolve the issue. If you encounter further problems, feel free to ask for additional help!
